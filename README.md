## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
1. Use **Next.js** for server-side rendering and routing.
2. Build a responsive UI using **Tailwind CSS**.
3. Implement reusable components for products, orders, and dashboards.

### Backend
1. Use **Express.js** for building RESTful APIs.
2. Set up secure routes for authentication and resource management.
3. Implement role-based access control (RBAC).

### Database
1. Use **PostgreSQL** for data storage.
2. Define models for users, products, orders, and vendors using **Prisma**.
3. Implement database migrations for schema changes.

### Deployment
1. Host the application on platforms like Vercel (Frontend) and Heroku or AWS (Backend).
2. Use environment variables to manage secrets like database credentials and JWT keys.
