# Project Requirements for Library Management System

## Overview
This project aims to build a comprehensive Library Management System that serves two primary purposes:

1. **Book Selling Module**: An e-commerce-like platform for selling books online.
2. **University Library Module**: A robust system to manage library resources for a university, including books, journals, and user memberships.

The system will be developed using the following tech stack:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Prisma
